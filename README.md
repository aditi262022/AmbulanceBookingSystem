Innovatively crafted an Ambulance Booking System employing Python, this project integrates a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, delivering an efficient and scalable application framework. The system, meticulously designed with Python’s diverse libraries and functionalities, offers a user-friendly interface for seamless booking and management of ambulance services.

The framework harnesses Python's os and datetime modules for file handling and timestamp management. The system's core functionalities encompass a dynamic menu-driven interface for booking, viewing, canceling, and searching ambulance records. Through the utilization of OS path resolutions, the program ensures cross-platform compatibility, allowing smooth operation across Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.

The booking mechanism generates unique IDs for each booking, recording essential details like name, contact, location, and timestamp. Additionally, it offers a comprehensive view of booking records in real-time, facilitating seamless management and monitoring of ambulance services.

Furthermore, the system provides an Emergency Contact feature allowing users to input and manage emergency contact numbers, ensuring quick access during critical situations. Additionally, it encompasses Emergency Instructions, guiding users on handling emergency situations effectively.

This project stands as a testament to Python’s versatility and efficiency in developing robust systems, demonstrating the adaptability of MVC architecture for streamlined application design and management in the healthcare domain.
